# Input datasets for Euro-Calliope

[Euro-Calliope](https://euro-calliope.readthedocs.io/) is a set of models of the European energy sytem and an automatic workflow to generate them.
Euro-Calliope is based on a variety of input data sets each of which describes a certain aspect of the energy system, like generation potentials, historical generation, and energy demand.
The workflow building all models does not contain data but instead automatically derives input data from their source where possible.
For some input data sets this is not possible and this folder includes these datasets.
