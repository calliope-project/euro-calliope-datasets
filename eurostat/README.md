# Eurostat dataset archive
Data in this directory are direct downloads from the statistical office of the European Commission's database, [Eurostat].
Eurostat datasets are not versioned or periodically archived, leading to unexpected inconsistencies that can enter into automatically downloaded datasets.
For instance, when sub-national NUTS administrative units are updated (every 3-5 years), member states are invited to update Eurostat datasets in line with changes to administrative units.
Some member states choose to do this, but not all. Equally, not all datasets are updated at the same time.
Also, when countries stop contributing data to Eurostat, such as the UK from 2021, historical data for certain datasets are lost entirely for that country.
Some datasets stored here may not differ from the current version available directly on Eurostat.
Nevertheless, we still store a static version here to mitigate against the possibility that a new version of the dataset does introduce inconsistencies.

The below named datasets are used in Euro-Calliope and have been downloaded before the UK left the European Union and before NUTS2021 entered into force.
File names correspond to respective Eurostat dataset codes.
Each dataset title is linked to the relevant Eurostat database download URL used to create this archive and can be used to access the latest version of the dataset.
No post-processing has been applied to the datasets following download.
